# Aqua Adventure 2
Second game in the Aqua Adventure series, made in Grade 11 Computer Science, built in Python. Main branch has an updated version for Python 3. Run main.py to play. I've uploaded it here so I can easily refer back to it.

Note: the updated version for Python 3 is barely tested; it may contain bugs and broken features resulting from the upgrade.


# The Series
Aqua Adventure 1 - basically a low effort asset flip made for a class in elementary school. It's not good and won't see the light of day.

Aqua Adventure 2 - this game! a text-based tale of humanity's destruction and your effort to save it. Basically the start of my game dev journey.

Aqua Adventure: Total Betrayal - a game set in the AA universe; collaborative project in grade 12? CS. Probably won't release this one.

Aqua Adventure 3 - the last Aqua Adventure game, made in Pygame. It's pretty barebones and rushed but has some (IMO) really cool ideas.


# The Future
I may or may not be slowly remaking a few of these games, but with actual development standards and time and effort. Only time will tell :)
